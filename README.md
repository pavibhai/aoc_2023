# Advent of Code 2023 <a id="AdventofCode2023"></a>

I have been trying out advent of code to help me learn Rust it has been so much fun. I owe a big thanks
to [Owen O'Malley](https://github.com/omalley) for introducing AOC to me and for
the [harness](https://github.com/omalley/advent_of_code_2023).

The harness has made many things much easier, letting us focus on the problem and the solution.
